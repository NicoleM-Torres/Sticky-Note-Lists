Create a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, manage, and remove tasks. This project will utilize HTML, CSS (optional Bootstrap for styling), and JavaScript to handle task management and user interactions.

Project Requirements:
1. Basic Features:
Task Input:
Create an input field where users can type in a new task.
Include a button labeled "Add Task" to submit the task to the list.

Task Display:
Display the tasks in a list format below the input field.
Each task should be shown as a list item, with a checkbox to mark the task as complete.

Task Removal:
Allow users to remove a task from the list by clicking a "Remove" button or icon next to each task.
Completed tasks should be distinguishable (e.g., crossed out, faded, or styled differently).

2. User Interface:
Design a simple and intuitive layout where tasks can be easily viewed, added, and removed.
Style the application using CSS or Bootstrap to ensure it is visually appealing and responsive on various devices.
3. Functional Requirements:
Adding Tasks: When the user types a task in the input field and clicks "Add Task," the task should appear in the task list below.
Marking Tasks as Complete: Each task should have a checkbox that allows the user to mark it as complete. The task should visually change to indicate completion.
Removing Tasks: Each task should have a "Remove" button or icon that removes the task from the list when clicked.
